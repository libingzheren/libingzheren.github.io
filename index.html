				<p>I am currently an Assistant  Professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Oklahoma State University. Prior to that, I was a Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, advised by Prof. David Du. I received my Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities in 2018, under the supervision of Prof. David Lilja. <br> <br>
				I am interested in two main research directions. One lies in computer systems, including memory/storage systems, systems architecture, and storage system security. The other focuses on low-cost hardware design in edge computing and IoT. Specifically,  my research fields include: <br> 
				&#8226; Intelligent storage system<br> 
				&#8226; Energy-efficient and low-power computing architecture<br> 
				&#8226; Machine learning<br> 
				&#8226; DNA Storage</p>
